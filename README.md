# missionaries_and_cannibals
An assignment for my CSE 471, Intro to AI, class.  The classic problem of having n missionaries and n cannibals on one side of a river with a goal to transport all of them to the other side safely.  The caveat being that the boat can only carry one or two people at a time, and the number of cannibals on one side of the river can never outnumber the number of missionaries.  This puzzle will be solved using the problem formulation method from the Russell/Norvig AI book.
